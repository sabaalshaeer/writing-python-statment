Open the interactive shell.
    From the PyCharm menu, select Toolsâ†’Python or Debug Console.
    Note: If you are prompted with a Windows Security Alert, select Allow access to allow PyCharm to access your network.
    Examine the Python console shown at the bottom of the PyCharm window.
    The Python console provides an interactive shell, a text-based console in which you can type commands and see results immediately.
    The variable list is a debugging tool that provides status information about data values you are working with.
Configure the layout of the Python console.
    Select the Show Variables button a few times, and observe the effect it has on the layout of the Python console.
    This is a toggle button that changes the visibility of the variable list, like an on/off switch.
    Make sure the three toggle buttons are selected as shown.
    Enabling the Soft Wrap setting causes lines of text in the Python console to wrap around when it reaches the right edge. If this option were not selected, you might have to scroll horizontally to see text that has run past the right edge.
    Enabling the Scroll to End setting causes the Python console to scroll automatically as new text is output to the console to ensure you're always looking at the most recent prompts and messages.
    Enabling the Show Variables setting displays the values of variables in your program as you run it, which can be helpful for testing and debugging.
Define variables and assign values to them.
    At the command prompt, type a = 5 and press Enter.
    At the command prompt, type b = 10 and press Enter.
    Observe the current state of the variables.
    The current values of a and b are shown.
Perform arithmetic operations on your variables.
    At the command prompt, enter a + b
    Verify the value that Python returns.
    The result of 15 is shown in the console.
    Write down your prediction of the value that should be returned by the statement a + b * a / b.
    Enter a + b * a / b and compare the result to the value you predicted.
Use the print() function to output messages to the console.
    Right-click the last statement you wrote in the Python console and select Clear All.
    In the variable list, examine the values shown for a and b. Even though you cleared the output, the values of a and b have been retained.
    At the command prompt, enter print(a)
    As you type the open parenthesis, the close parenthesis is automatically provided, so you don't have to type it.
    Enter print(b)
    Verify that Python prints 5 and 10 to the console.
    Enter print("Hello, world!")
    Verify that Python prints Hello, world! to the console.
    Using escape codes, print to the console so that you receive the following output:
    I've successfully used an "escape code."
